⚠️ IMPORTANT: Model and Data Files

Due to GitHub's file size limits, the large model and data files are not included in this repository.

To download the necessary files:

1. Download from Google Drive or alternative storage:
   - models/best_model.joblib
   - models/scaler.joblib
   - models/training_results.joblib
   - data/feature_names.csv (included)
   - data/X_train.csv
   - data/X_test.csv
   - data/y_train.csv
   - data/y_test.csv
   - data/raw_diabetic_data.csv

2. Place them in the respective folders:
   - models/ folder
   - data/ folder

3. Run the dashboard:
   streamlit run app.py

The dashboard requires these files to work properly.

Alternatively, for Streamlit Cloud deployment:
- Contact the repository owner for access to model files
- Or train the model locally first using: python src/data_preprocessing.py
